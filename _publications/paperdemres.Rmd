  This article examines whether parental work intensity buffers the effects of poverty on children’s outcomes in the United States. Using longitudinal data, I find that higher parental work hours can mitigate some negative impacts of income poverty on child development. The study highlights the protective role of stable employment beyond income alone. Findings have implications for both family policy and labor market regulation.
